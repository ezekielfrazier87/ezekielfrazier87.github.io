	CoinGecko data shows that BTC added 6%, its highest 24-hour price increase since May, triggering a wider market recovery. Ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP) added 8%, BNB Chain’s BNB rose 12%, and Solana’s SOL surged as much as 16%.
The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens by market capitalization minus stablecoins, jumped 7.26% and recorded over $95 million in trading volumes.
Japan's Topix jumped about 10% as the yen weakened against the U.S. dollar, snapping a five-day surge. Futures tracking the S&P 500 rose 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.1%. Renewed hopes for faster Fed rate cuts in the wake of Monday's global market slide seem to have restored risk sentiment.
Still, crypto market watchers remain cautious about a continued rally among major tokens.
“We might see a corrective rebound in Bitcoin's price,” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, told CoinDesk in a Tuesday email. “However, this increase will likely be limited due to the prevailing pessimism in the broader markets.”
